'Pierre is a central character in "War and Peace" by Tolstoy. He is described as having a troubled past and experiencing unhappiness before the events of 1812. Young Nicholas, another character in the story, idolizes Pierre and sees him as a hero and a saint due to his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, and his friendship with Nicholas\' father. Pierre is also known for his love for Natásha, whom Nicholas is particularly fond of. Pierre is welcomed by guests because he has a talent for enlivening and uniting any company he is in (Chapter 24).\n\nPierre is also visited by a doctor who considers it his duty to pose as a man of value to suffering humanity. The doctor spends hours with Pierre, sharing anecdotes and observations about his patients, especially the ladies. Pierre also forms a friendship with a young Italian officer who expresses tenderness and admiration towards him. The Italian visits Pierre to talk about his past, his life at home, his love, and his indignation against the French and Napoleon (Chapter 22).\n\nYoung Nicholas, who adores Pierre, sees him as a role model. He wants to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre\'s presence, Nicholas is filled with pleasure and listens attentively to everything Pierre says (Chapter 22).\n\nPierre\'s life takes a drastic turn when he is arrested by French soldiers. He is questioned in French and does not respond. The officer assumes he does not speak French and calls for an interpreter. Pierre\'s appearance and behavior during this encounter are described as terrible, and he is treated with suspicion (Chapter 22).\n\nDespite Pierre\'s attempts to deny being French, a French officer insists on his gratitude towards Pierre for saving his life. Pierre finds it difficult to refuse the officer\'s polite and amiable demeanor, even though he does not fully understand Pierre\'s feelings. Pierre\'s kindness and willingness to help others disarm those around him (Chapter 21).\n\nIn another instance, Pierre\'s presence among soldiers makes an unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers look at him with surprise and even alarm. A young officer sternly asks Pierre to stand aside, and the soldiers disapprove of Pierre\'s presence (Chapter 21).\n\nLastly, Pierre encounters Borís, who invites him to dinner with Count Rostóv. Initially mistaking Borís for Ilyá, Pierre recalls their past adventures together. However, Borís corrects him and reveals his true identity as the son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya. Pierre becomes flustered and realizes he has mixed up his memories (Chapter 21).\n\nOverall, Pierre is a complex character who undergoes various experiences and relationships throughout the novel. He is admired by some and misunderstood by others, but his presence always leaves an impact on those around him.'
