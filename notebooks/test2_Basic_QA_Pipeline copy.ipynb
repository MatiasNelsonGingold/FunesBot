    "# Tutorial: Build Your First Question Answering System\n",
    "\n",
    "> We've modified this first tutorial to make it simpler to start with. If you're looking for a Question Answering tutorial that uses a DocumentStore such as Elasticsearch, go to our new [Build a Scalable Question Answering System](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/03_scalable_qa_system) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level**: Beginner\n",
    "- **Time to complete**: 15 minutes\n",
    "- **Nodes Used**: `InMemoryDocumentStore`, `BM25Retriever`, `FARMReader`\n",
    "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you will have learned about the Reader and Retriever, and built a question answering pipeline that can answer questions about the Game of Thrones series.\n"

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn how to build a question answering system using Haystack's DocumentStore, Retriever, and Reader. Your system will use Game of Thrones files and will be able to answer questions like \"Who is the father of Arya Stark?\". But you can use it to run on any other set of documents, such as your company's internal wikis or a collection of financial reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started quicker, we simplified certain steps in this tutorial. For example, Document preparation and pipeline initialization are handled by ready-made classes that replace lines of initialization code. But don't worry! This doesn't affect how well the question answering system performs."

    "We'll start creating our question answering system by initializing a DocumentStore. A DocumentStore stores the Documents that the question answering system uses to find answers to your questions. In this tutorial, we're using the `InMemoryDocumentStore`, which is the simplest DocumentStore to get started with. It requires no external dependencies and it's a good option for smaller projects and debugging. But it doesn't scale up so well to larger Document collections, so it's not a good choice for production systems. To learn more about the DocumentStore and the different types of external databases that we support, see [DocumentStore](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store).\n",

      "content=\"Answer the question According to Anna Pavlovna, what illness was she suffering from? With the context found in the text within the list ['A good many people had already arrived, but Anna\\\\nPávlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room,\\\\ndid not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general\\\\nconversation.\\\\n\\\\nThe news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezúkhova.\\\\nShe had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed\\\\nseveral gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said\\\\nto be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors\\\\nwho usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor\\\\nwho was treating her in some new and unusual way.\\\\n\\\\nThey all knew very well that the enchanting countess’ illness arose from\\\\nan inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,\\\\nand that the Italian’s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience;\\\\nbut in Anna Pávlovna’s presence no one dared to think of this or even\\\\nappear to know it.\\\\n\\\\n“They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina\\\\npectoris.”\\\\n\\\\n“Angina? Oh, that’s a terrible illness!”\\\\n\\\\n“They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...” and\\\\nthe word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.\\\\n\\\\n', 'After the affair at\\\\nOstróvna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar\\\\nbattalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.\\\\n\\\\nCHAPTER XVI\\\\n\\\\nOn receiving news of Natásha’s illness, the countess, though not quite\\\\nwell yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Pétya and the rest of the\\\\nhousehold, and the whole family moved from Márya Dmítrievna’s house to\\\\ntheir own and settled down in town.\\\\n\\\\nNatásha’s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for\\\\nher parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness,\\\\nher conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the\\\\nbackground. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider\\\\nin how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat\\\\nor sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them\\\\nfeel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help\\\\nher. ', 'But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war,\\\\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\\\\nAntichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing\\\\nmore to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my\\\\n‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I\\\\nhave frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”\\\\n\\\\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna\\\\nSchérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.\\\\nWith these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high\\\\nrank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna\\\\nPávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering\\\\nfrom la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used\\\\nonly by the elite.\\\\n\\\\n', 'At dinner Anna Mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news\\\\nand about Nikólenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received\\\\nfrom him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might\\\\nvery likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these\\\\nhints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at\\\\nthe count and at Anna Mikháylovna, the latter very adroitly turned\\\\nthe conversation to insignificant matters. Natásha, who, of the whole\\\\nfamily, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of\\\\nintonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning\\\\nof the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her\\\\nfather and Anna Mikháylovna, that it had something to do with her\\\\nbrother, and that Anna Mikháylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as\\\\nshe was, Natásha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything\\\\nrelating to Nikólenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner,\\\\nbut she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her\\\\nchair regardless of her governess’ remarks. ', 'Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had\\\\nagain quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade\\\\nthem again, but the salons of Anna Pávlovna and Hélène remained just\\\\nas they had been—the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna\\\\nPávlovna’s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte’s successes just\\\\nas before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the\\\\nEuropean sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was\\\\nto cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna\\\\nPávlovna was the representative. And in Hélène’s salon, which Rumyántsev\\\\nhimself honored with his visits, regarding Hélène as a remarkably\\\\nintelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808\\\\nof the “great nation” and the “great man,” and regretted our rupture\\\\nwith France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly\\\\nterminated by peace.\\\\n\\\\nOf late, since the Emperor’s return from the army, there had been some\\\\nexcitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations\\\\nof hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency.\\\\n', 'But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: “How is...” and hesitated,\\\\nnot knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man “the\\\\ncount,” yet ashamed to call him “father.”\\\\n\\\\n“He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my\\\\nfriend...”\\\\n\\\\nPierre’s mind was in such a confused state that the word “stroke”\\\\nsuggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasíli\\\\nin perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of\\\\nillness. Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went\\\\nthrough the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his\\\\nwhole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and\\\\nthe priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.\\\\nThrough that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and\\\\nat last Anna Mikháylovna, still with the same expression, pale but\\\\nresolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly\\\\non the arm said:\\\\n\\\\n“The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be\\\\nadministered. ', 'When Anna Mikháylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov’s the money, all\\\\nin clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess’\\\\nlittle table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating\\\\nher.\\\\n\\\\n“Well, my dear?” asked the countess.\\\\n\\\\n“Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so\\\\nill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...”\\\\n\\\\n“Annette, for heaven’s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess\\\\nbegan, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,\\\\nelderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.\\\\n\\\\nAnna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be\\\\nready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.\\\\n\\\\n“This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.”\\\\n\\\\nAnna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess\\\\nwept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were\\\\nkindhearted, and because they—friends from childhood—had to think\\\\nabout such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....\\\\nBut those tears were pleasant to them both.\\\\n\\\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\\\n\\\\nCountess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was\\\\nalready seated in the drawing room. ', 'Then let us imagine that the combatant who\\\\nso sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was\\\\nat the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to\\\\nconceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory\\\\nwith the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what\\\\nconfusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.\\\\n\\\\nThe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was\\\\nthe French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up\\\\nthe cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter\\\\naccording to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described\\\\nthe event.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the burning of Smolénsk a war began which did not follow any\\\\nprevious traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the\\\\nretreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodinó and the renewed\\\\nretreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of\\\\ntransports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.\\\\n\\\\n', 'Rousing himself, Pierre\\\\nfollowed Anna Mikháylovna out of the carriage, and only then began\\\\nto think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He\\\\nnoticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back\\\\ndoor. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who\\\\nlooked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the\\\\nshadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other\\\\nmen of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.\\\\nBut neither Anna Mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who\\\\ncould not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. “It seems\\\\nto be all right,” Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikháylovna.\\\\nShe hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to\\\\nPierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it\\\\nwas necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had\\\\nto go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna’s air\\\\nof assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely\\\\nnecessary. ', 'After a moment’s silence Natásha answered: “Yes, ill.”\\\\n\\\\nIn reply to the count’s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected\\\\nand whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him\\\\nthat nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. Márya Dmítrievna\\\\nconfirmed Natásha’s assurances that nothing had happened. From\\\\nthe pretense of illness, from his daughter’s distress, and by the\\\\nembarrassed faces of Sónya and Márya Dmítrievna, the count saw clearly\\\\nthat something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible\\\\nfor him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved\\\\ndaughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he\\\\navoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly\\\\nhad happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition\\\\ndelayed their return to the country.\\\\n\\\\nCHAPTER XIX\\\\n\\\\nFrom the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go\\\\naway somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rostóvs came\\\\nto Moscow the effect Natásha had on him made him hasten to carry out\\\\nhis intention. ']\\n\" additional_kwargs={} example=False\n"
